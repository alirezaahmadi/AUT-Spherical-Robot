# AUT-Spherical-Robot
A Spherical Mobile Robot with PendulumÂ  drive Control

The  proposed  3D-CAD  model  shown  in  Fig.1  consists  of  three  basic  units;  namely  shell,  inside  drive  unit  and  pendulum  mechanism.  In  order  to  make  the  mechanical  design robust and powerful, gear drive has been used. There is a  set  of  main  motors  driving  the  IDU  around  the  horizontal  axis  and  the  vertical  axis.  For  simplicity,  two  motors  are  donated  as  motor1  (M1)  and  motor2  (M2).  M1  generates  the  driving torque about the vertical axis to make the sphere rotate along  the  straight  line  and  M2  generates  the  leaning  torque  about the horizontal axis to make the sphere to turn. The main concern  during  the  design  phase  was  how  to  balance  the  masses about the axes so that the neutral equilibrium while the robot   is   not   in   motion   is   kept   maintained.   To   facilitate   manufacturing  and  assembly,  it  was  decided  to  design  the  spherical shell into two halves. Initially, the robot is controlled via  the  Android  application  which  is  portable  and  can  be  installed on any smartphone. A wireless camera has been used to monitor the robot remotely. Then two schemes are proposed to control the robot autonomously.
